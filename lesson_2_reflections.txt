What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the ".git" directory and indicates that this directory is now related to git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allow us to choose precisely what files we want to put in a commit. If, for example, you have 2 unrelated bugs in differents files but you want to correct both of them nearly at the same time to see how it works then, you correct those 2 and then commit twice, first for 1 bug an then for the other.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can choose what to add or not to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If you can implement an experimental feature or test something new that you are not so sure about. Having a branch really separated from the master helps us to experiment without fearing breaking something that already works.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The graph gives us a better understanding seeing quickly where are created the new branches and all their relative commits.
