When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is more safe than only local and it helps us to collaborate really easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If someone else changes something on the remote while you're already working on other things, it might break your program synchronising automatically.
