When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is more safe than only local and it helps us to collaborate really easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If someone else changes something on the remote while you're already working on other things, it might break your program synchronising automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy a repository on Github to another location in Github. 
A clone is a copy on a git repository from which you can directly pull and push.
A branch is a new "way" created inside a repository itself to work on things that need to be tested or in parallel.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Help us to see I someone else has changed something that could interest us.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Nearly everything would be harder.
